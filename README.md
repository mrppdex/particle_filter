## Overview

This is the 3rd project of the 2nd term of Udacity's Self-Driving Car engineer nanodegree. The goal is to implement a particle filter, that gets initial noisy location from simulated GPS data and then tries to locate the vehicle thanks to the landmark positions it gets from the vehicle sensors and the map.

The vehicle's position is indicated by the car, the best patricle's location and yaw are indicated by the blue circle:
